;;Purpose of the script is to generate the security check roster for FS.
;;Right now, input file dependencies are names.txt (just a vector
;;of strings in a text file) for a stack of names
;;for the roster and weeks.txt (just a vector of strings in a txt file)
;;for the weeks included in the roster.
;;roster-from will also prep the input files for the next roster

            [clojure.string :as str]
            [clojure.java.io :as io]))

;;todo 1: function to make a new roster from scratch without depending
;;on inputs from last roster.  I think these inputs would be:
;;names.txt, which week to start (make sure it's a Monday)-generates
;;weeks.txt first, call make-inputs for input files,
;;
;;todo 2: make uberjar file for non-Clojurfied user

Unavailable means that you expect to have at least two days during the

excluding federal holidays) or go home for the day before 1400.
