"Purpose of the script is to generate the security check roster for FS.
Right now, input file dependencies are names.txt for a stack of names
for the roster and weeks.txt for the weeks included in the roster.
roster-from will also prep the input files for the next roster"

;;todo: function to make a new roster from scratch without depending
;;on inputs from last roster.  I think these inputs would be: names.txt, which week to start
;;(make sure it's a Monday)-generates weeks.txt first, call make-inputs for input files,
;;

;1) Vector of names ["Rick" "Tom" "Craig"]
;2) Map of unavailable days {"04/19/17" #{"Rick"} "04/26/17" #{"Rick" "Craig"}}
;3) Weeks ["04/12/17" "04/19/17" "04/26/17"]
